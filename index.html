                    <p> There was nothing more relaxing than feeling the cool breeze, during the mid summer on the gulf. I visit my brother every summer in Mobile, Alabama. There is not much to do there, so fishing became a hobby. Similarly to Tennessee, which is where I was originally born, Mobile, Alabama has great outdoor activitites. That is if you're into hunting, fishing, and nature. I was borned and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. I have been driving trucks for a living since 2017. Although, truck driving is a cool career, I never intended it to be doing it for the rest of my life. I was always into tech, but I never thought about pursuing it because when I was younger, I was not ready to accept it's challenges. I knew it would be very difficult to learn, so I decided to try different career paths in college. I didn't finish with a degree because I was undecisive about choosing a major. Truck driving allowed me to make good money, but I always felt that I could do more. As I became older, I became more willing to take on more of a difficult task in tech. Only, I didn't think I would be able to obtain a career in tech without a college degree. Throughout the years, I have been hearing more and more about bootcamps online that can lead you to careers like software engineer. That's why I am here today. I want to take on the challenge, change my career, and become a software engineer. It would be a proud accomplishment.</p>

           <p>Enjoying a day in the park is one of the many activities I enjoy in the summer. This particular summer was my first time experiencing circadas. These are bug that live in the ground for seventeen years, then they'll come up and fly every where. I remember, during that year, President Biden was getting off the plane that landed in Washington, D.C., swatted one off his face. I did leave the park early that day. Other activities I like to do outside are skating and riding bicycles on trails. </p>
